# Transport Maintenance

Creating a basic (to-learn) web app used to connect any transport user and the owner/driver by introducing the concept of groups.
A group will contain a leader that is the owner(or driver) whose location can be viewed on duty by the rest of the members.
This can also be used to communicate and change the route for the driver to follow depending upon the members attendance.

Uses Bootstrap,php
To be modelled in an React as a progressive web app later.
